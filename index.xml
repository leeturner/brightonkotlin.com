      <title>Scaling UI across platforms with Server Driven UI by Joe Birch</title>

      <description>Mobile, Web, Desktop&amp;hellip; when working with multiple platforms for your product, you might start to feel like there is a lot for your team to maintain. If we update the design for a feature or want to test a new layout, we often need to make that change in multiple clients. This results in more time spent on the same task in multiple places, with less time being able to focus on delivering even more value to your users.</description>

      <description>Hot topics at KotlinConf, Coroutines and Flow provide an efficient way to handle asynchronous data streams.
In this talk Joe will explore how we can use some of the basics from these APIs to provide fluid experiences for our users and avoid callback hell in our code. He’ll point out some of the common pitfalls along and way and look at how we can migrate from RxJava to Flow for reactive programming in Kotlin.</description>

      <description>Even though it is short notice, we thought what better way to finish the year than gathering in a pub and having a few drinks to celebrate a great end to the year.

We already have some great speakers lined up for the beginning of 2020 and we will be publishing those events very soon but for now, join us to toast the end of the year in Brighton Kotlin style.</description>
