      <description>Functional Programming is an excellent way to simplify your code and reduce bugs, and to make things even better, Kotlin provides a natural transition to using Functional Programming paradigms. But before that, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about what Functional Programming even is. In this talk, we&amp;rsquo;ll break down the key aspects of what defines Functional Programming and the key benefits of using Functional Programming paradigms. Then we&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through how to use Functional Programming more in your Kotlin code to really have the best of both worlds.</description>

      <description>Http4k is a lightweight HTTP library written in Kotlin that enables serving and consuming of HTTP services in a functional and testable way. Unlike many other libraries and frameworks which have complicated abstractions and workflows, http4k captures the essence of communication over HTTP with a few simple concepts. In this session I will explain and demo the core concepts in http4k by live coding from scratch an HTTP server which will simulate the board from the noughts and crosses game.</description>

      <title>Scaling UI across platforms with Server Driven UI by Joe Birch</title>

      <description>Mobile, Web, Desktop&amp;hellip; when working with multiple platforms for your product, you might start to feel like there is a lot for your team to maintain. If we update the design for a feature or want to test a new layout, we often need to make that change in multiple clients. This results in more time spent on the same task in multiple places, with less time being able to focus on delivering even more value to your users.</description>

      <description>Hot topics at KotlinConf, Coroutines and Flow provide an efficient way to handle asynchronous data streams.
In this talk Joe will explore how we can use some of the basics from these APIs to provide fluid experiences for our users and avoid callback hell in our code. He’ll point out some of the common pitfalls along and way and look at how we can migrate from RxJava to Flow for reactive programming in Kotlin.</description>

      <description>Even though it is short notice, we thought what better way to finish the year than gathering in a pub and having a few drinks to celebrate a great end to the year.
It would be great to see at the Hope and Ruin on the 16th December from 6:30pm on-wards
We already have some great speakers lined up for the beginning of 2020 and we will be publishing those events very soon but for now, join us to toast the end of the year in Brighton Kotlin style.</description>
