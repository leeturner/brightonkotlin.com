        "content": "<div id=\"preamble\">\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The Google Developer Groups, Kotlin User Groups and other Community Groups organizing these events [\"Organizers\"] are dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive event experience for everyone regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected category. They do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. The Organizers take violations of this policy seriously and will respond appropriately.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>All participants in these events must abide by the following policy:<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"olist arabic\">\n<ol class=\"arabic\">\n<li>\n<p>Be excellent to each other. The Organizers want the events to be an excellent experience for everyone regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected category. Treat everyone with respect. Participate while acknowledging that everyone deserves to be at the event&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and each of us has the right to enjoy the experience without fear of harassment, discrimination, or condescension, whether blatant or via micro-aggressions. Jokes shouldn\u2019t demean others. Consider what you are saying and how it would feel if it were said to or about you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Speak up if you see or hear something. Harassment is not tolerated, and you are empowered to politely engage when you or others are disrespected. The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing, and politely bringing their behavior to their attention is encouraged. If a participant engages in harassing or uncomfortable behavior, the Organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning or expelling the offender from the event with no refund. If you are being harassed or feel uncomfortable, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event staff immediately.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Harassment is not tolerated. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: verbal language that reinforces social structures of domination related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected category; sexual imagery in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; offensive verbal language; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Practice saying \"Yes and\" to each other. It\u2019s a theatre improv technique to build on each other\u2019s ideas. We all benefit when we create together.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This policy extends to talks, forums, workshops, codelabs, social media, parties, hallway conversations, all attendees, partners, sponsors, volunteers, event staff, etc. You catch our drift. The Organizers reserve the right to refuse admittance to, or remove any person from, the event (including future events organizer by the Group) at any time in its sole discretion. This includes, but is not limited to, attendees behaving in a disorderly manner or failing to comply with this policy, and the terms and conditions herein. If a participant engages in harassing or uncomfortable behavior, the Organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning or expelling the offender from the event with no refund.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The event staff can usually be identified by special badges/attire. The zero tolerance policy means that the Organizers will look into and review every allegation of violation of the Event Community Guidelines and Anti-Harassment Policy and respond appropriately. Please note, while they take all concerns raised seriously, they will use their discretion as to determining when and how to follow up on reported incidents, and may decline to take any further action and/or may direct the participant to other resources for resolution.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Event staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing discomfort or harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. They value your attendance.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Exhibiting partners, sponsors or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to this policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment. Participants and exhibiting partners or sponsors disobeying this policy will be notified and are expected to stop any offending behavior immediately.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_license_and_attribution\">License and attribution<\/h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This policy is licensed under the <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\">Creative Commons Zero license<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This policy is based on and influenced by several other community policies including: Ohio LinuxFest Anti-Harassment policy, Con Anti-Harassment Project, Geek Feminism Wiki (created by the Ada Initiative), ConfCodeofConduct.com, JSconf, Rust, Diversity in Python, and Write/Speak/Code.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Original source - <a href=\"https://events.withgoogle.com/kotlin-everywhere/community-guidelines/\" class=\"bare\">https://events.withgoogle.com/kotlin-everywhere/community-guidelines/<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"
