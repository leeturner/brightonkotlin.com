      <description>It was great to see so many people come along to the first ever Brighton Kotlin meetup. It really showed that there is an active Kotlin community in Brighton with people working on projects using a range of technologies from the Kotlin ecosystem. You can see the photos of the event at our meetup page - https://www.meetup.com/Brighton-Kotlin/photos/30344969/
At this meetup Lee Turner talked about how Crunch have been introducing Kotlin into their backend microservice architecture over the past year, the results and challenges they have seen during that time and where they plan to take it next.</description>
