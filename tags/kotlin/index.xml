      <description>We are very excited to welcome Marty Pitt from Orbital. He will be giving a talk on Using Kotlin Type Aliases To Automate Microservice Integration
As teams embrace microservices, and the number of APIs, Topics and DBs explode, integration can become time-consuming to build, and a maintenance nightmare.
This talk explores using semantic metadata (powered by Kotlin type aliases) to automate integration between all your APIs, Message queues, serverless functions and more.</description>

      <description>We are very excited to welcome Sergio del Amo Caballero. He will be giving a talk on Getting Started with the Micronaut Framework
In this session, Sergio del Amo introduces the MicronautÂ® framework and demonstrates how the Framework&amp;rsquo;s unique compile-time approach enables the development of ultra-lightweight Java applications.
Compelling aspects of the Micronaut framework include:
Develop applications with Java, Kotlin, or Apache Groovy Sub-second startup time Small processes that can run in as little as 10 MB of JVM heap No runtime reflection Dependency injection and AOP Reflection-free serialization A database access toolkit that uses ahead-of-time (AoT) compilation to pre-compute queries for repository interfaces.</description>
