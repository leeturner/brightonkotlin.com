The June Brighton Kotlin meetup takes place on Thursday 27th June at 6 pm GMT. We will be opening zoom just before 6pm for people to gather and chat. The link will be sent out on the day of the talk. The event will begin around 6pm.

We'll be welcoming our second speaker - Luca Nicoletti who will give a talk called *Compose your Trill*

This talk will cover the following topic:

- Jetpack Compose: what it is, how should you use
- Implementation: how we are using it at Triller
- Side by side: showcase code for the same (simple) screen made with "old" Android's technologies and with the "new" Jetpack Compose toolkit
- Summary: is it worth using Compose? How easy is it to use it an existing app? Is it stable? How reliable is it?
- Conclusion: will we keep working with this technology?
