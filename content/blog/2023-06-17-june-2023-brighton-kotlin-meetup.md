We will be taking a break from our usual schedule of talks to get together with our sister group, Brighton JUG, with an IRL social and kick off the summer with a few drinks at the Foundary pub in Brighton

We hope to see as many of you as can make it:

29th June, 2023  
13-14 Foundry St, Brighton, Brighton and Hove, Brighton BN1 4AT
