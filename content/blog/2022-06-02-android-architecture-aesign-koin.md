-------- Arnaud Giuliani ------ Android Architecture Design with Koin

Koin (https://insert-koin.io) is a pragmatic dependency injection framework for Kotlin/Android developers, well known for its ease of use.

In this session, I propose to see together how we can structure our components, for the following topics:

* Classical Components in MVP, MVVM
* Dealing with Scopes
* Jetpack Navigation
* Jetpack Compose
* Integrating with Multi-Platform
* And an overview of incoming new features.
