We are very excited to welcome **Robert Elliot** to our September meetup. He will be giving a talk on **Transparent http client testing with http4K and WireMock**

**Event Format: Hybrid**

*   Join us online: 6:30pm on YouTube - TBD

One of http4k's great selling points is that it has a uniform client and server interface. WireMock is a popular library for stubbing out remote HTTP services locally.

Less well known is that WireMock can run without listening on a port. In this talk we'll explore how we can adapt http4k's interface to WireMock's API to allow the same tests to be run both over the wire and purely in memory against WireMock.
