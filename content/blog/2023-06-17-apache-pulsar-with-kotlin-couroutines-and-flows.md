Come and join us by signing up on our meetup page: [https://www.meetup.com/brighton-kotlin/events/294227622/](https://www.meetup.com/brighton-kotlin/events/294227622/)

We are very excited to welcome **Michele Sollecito** to our July meetup. He will be giving a talk on **Apache Pulsar with Kotlin coroutines and flows**

**Event Format: Hybrid**

*   Join us in-person: 6:00pm @ [Pizza Pilgrims, Brighton](https://goo.gl/maps/ZPuDh6w8vz3H7KbQ9)
*   Join us online: 6:30pm on YouTube - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbeK486FTyU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbeK486FTyU)

We'll explore how Kotlin makes consuming and producing messages from/to Apache Pulsar easy. We'll look at some tests, and discuss how coroutines and flows work great with this kind of reactive and event-driven use cases.

Apache Pulsar is an open-source, distributed messaging and streaming platform built for the cloud. Its features include multi-tenancy with resource separation and access control, geo-replication across regions, and tiered storage.
