Welcome to our November Brighton Kotlin featuring Kübra Harmankaya as our guest speaker!

If you are new to Kotlin or interested in Kotlin on mobile, this is a great meetup for you. Kubra will share her experiences why we should convert Android applications into modern Kotlin, how to start converting a Java project and best Kotlin practices.

Kübra has contributed to Android apps for FC Barcelona, Premier League, British Council and for many other companies. She is a big fan of Kotlin. She is a GDG and WTM lead since 2014.

A big thank you to our sponsors for this event - Hays Digital Tech for providing the venue and drinks:

Hays Digital Tech, 2nd Floor, International House, 78-81 Queens Rd, Brighton, BN1 3XE

This meetup is also supported by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) who have provided us with a 1-year subscription to any of their IDEs. This free one year subscription will be raffled off during the meetup. All attendees will be automatically entered and a winner will be selected at random on the night.

You can also expect some Kotlin stickers as well :)
