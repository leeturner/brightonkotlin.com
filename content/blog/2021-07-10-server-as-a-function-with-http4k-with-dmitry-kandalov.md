Http4k is a lightweight HTTP library written in Kotlin that enables serving and consuming of HTTP services in a functional and testable way. Unlike many other libraries and frameworks which have complicated abstractions and workflows, http4k captures the essence of communication over HTTP with a few simple concepts. In this session I will explain and demo the core concepts in http4k by live coding from scratch an HTTP server which will simulate the board from the noughts and crosses game.
