In the second of our 2022 talks will be welcoming Arnaud Giuliani, the creator of the [Koin](https://insert-koin.io) framework. 

Koin is a pragmatic dependency injection framework for Kotlin/Android developers, well known for its ease of use.

In this session, I propose to see together how we can structure our components, for the following topics:

* Classical Components in MVP, MVVM
* Dealing with Scopes
* Jetpack Navigation
* Jetpack Compose
* Integrating with Multi-Platform

And an overview of incoming new features.
