Hot topics at KotlinConf, Coroutines and Flow provide an efficient way to handle asynchronous data streams.

In this talk Joe will explore how we can use some of the basics from these APIs to provide fluid experiences for our users and avoid callback hell in our code. Heâ€™ll point out some of the common pitfalls along and way and look at how we can migrate from RxJava to Flow for reactive programming in Kotlin.

A big thank you to our sponsors for this event - Hays Digital Tech for providing the venue and drinks and Capgemini for providing the pizzas.

This meetup is also supported by JetBrains who have provided us with a 1-year subscription to any of their IDEs. This free one year subscription will be raffled off during the meetup. All attendees will be automatically entered, and a winner will be selected at random on the night.
