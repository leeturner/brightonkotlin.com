This will be the inaugural Brighton Kotlin meetup. The talks on the night are yet to be announced.

The meetup is hosted and sponsored by [Crunch](https://medium.com/@crunchtech) who are providing pizza and a choice of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.

RSVPs close at 5pm on the day, with Doors at 6:30pm. Talks will begin at 7:15pm.

This meetup is also supported by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) who have provided us with a 1-year subscription to any of their IDEs. This free one year subscription will be raffled off during the meetup. All attendees will be automatically entered, and a winner will be selected at random on the night. You can also expect some Kotlin stickers as well :)
