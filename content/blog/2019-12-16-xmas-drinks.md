Even though it is short notice, we thought what better way to finish the year than gathering in a pub and having a few drinks to celebrate a great end to the year.

It would be great to see at the Hope and Ruin on the 16th December from 6:30pm on-wards

We already have some great speakers lined up for the beginning of 2020 and we will be publishing those events very soon but for now, join us to toast the end of the year in Brighton Kotlin style.
