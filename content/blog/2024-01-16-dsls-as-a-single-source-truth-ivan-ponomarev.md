We are very excited to welcome **Ivan Ponomarev** as the first Brighton Kotlin speaker of 2024. Ivan is a Staff Software
Engineer at Synthesized and will be giving a talk on - **One Source to Rule Them All: Kotlin DSLs as a Single Source of
Truth for Multiple Tasks**

In this talk, I will discuss how the DSL feature in the Kotlin language aids in building better products. We'll explore
the motivation for using DSLs, differentiating between external and internal DSLs, and delve into the advantages and
limitations of internal Kotlin DSLs. I will provide examples demonstrating how the 'DSL approach' to building APIs
within your code can enhance code quality. Additionally, I will cover methods for checking the consistency of DSL
scripts and present a practical example of using a DSL to define a set of rules, generate documentation for them,
visualize, and execute them.
