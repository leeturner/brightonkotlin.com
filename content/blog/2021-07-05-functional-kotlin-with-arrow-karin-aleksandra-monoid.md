The July Brighton Kotlin meetup takes place on Thursday 22nd July at 6 pm GMT. We will be opening the zoom just before 6pm for people to gather and chat.

We'll be welcoming Karin-Aleksandra Monoid who will be talking about Functional Kotlin with Arrow:

What is a monad? Do I need a PhD to write in functional style? How do I do that in Kotlin? And other questions that you were afraid to ask.

In this talk, we'll walk through Arrow Core, the functional companion to the Kotlin standard library. We'll cover both the concepts that every software engineer may add to their project right now and more advanced structures, starting from non-empty list, going over Validated and Either followed by monad comprehension.
