We are extremely lucky to have a talk this month by George Herbert from Capgemini where he will discuss how Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) was implemented at HMRC.

During this talk, he will talk about the reasons behind the use of KMP and how he made it work with iOS, Android and Web. Come along to find out whether KMP could be used in your projects or maybe just to pique your interest into the world of KMP!

RSVPs close at 5pm on the day, with Doors at 6:30pm. Talks will begin at 7:15pm. We will finish up with a drink or two at the pub

This event is hosted by Hays Brighton, 78-81 Queens Rd, Brighton

This meetup is also supported by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) who have provided us with a 1-year subscription to any of their IDEs. This free one year subscription will be raffled off during the meetup. All attendees will be automatically entered and a winner will be selected at random on the night.

You can also expect some Kotlin stickers as well :)
