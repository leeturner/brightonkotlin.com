We are very excited to welcome Sergio del Amo Caballero. He will be giving a talk on Getting Started with the Micronaut Framework

In this session, Sergio del Amo introduces the MicronautÂ® framework and demonstrates how the Framework's unique compile-time approach enables the development of ultra-lightweight Java applications.

Compelling aspects of the Micronaut framework include:

* Develop applications with Java, Kotlin, or Apache Groovy
* Sub-second startup time
* Small processes that can run in as little as 10 MB of JVM heap
* No runtime reflection
* Dependency injection and AOP
* Reflection-free serialization
* A database access toolkit that uses ahead-of-time (AoT) compilation to pre-compute queries for repository interfaces.
* Cloud-native features Sergio also demonstrates how you can generate GraalVM native images of your Micronaut applications to achieve instant startup and ultra-low memory footprint.
