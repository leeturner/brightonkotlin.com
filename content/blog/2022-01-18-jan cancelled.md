Unfortunately the first meetup of 2022 had to be cancelled due to some problematic people on the call and not having the best Zoom setup in place.  You can find all the details on the Jan meetup page in the comments - https://www.meetup.com/Brighton-Kotlin/events/282800639/

This has now been addressed, and we are looking forward to our Feb meetup.  Come and join us - https://www.meetup.com/Brighton-Kotlin/events/283500154/
