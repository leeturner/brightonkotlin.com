We are very excited to welcome Marty Pitt from Orbital. He will be giving a talk on Using Kotlin Type Aliases To Automate Microservice Integration

As teams embrace microservices, and the number of APIs, Topics and DBs explode, integration can become time-consuming to build, and a maintenance nightmare.

This talk explores using semantic metadata (powered by Kotlin type aliases) to automate integration between all your APIs, Message queues, serverless functions and more.

We'll see how semantic metadata can replace integration code, and see integration automatically adapt as we introduce breaking changes.
