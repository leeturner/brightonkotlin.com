**Brighton Kotlin is Supported By Silicon Brighton**

<img src="/images/silicon-brighton.jpg" alt="Silicon Brighton" style="float:left; padding: 10px;"/>[Silicon Brighton](https://siliconbrighton.com) is a community-led initiative to support digital growth in the region. We work hand-in-hand with the local tech community to provide individuals with free opportunities for networking, training, up-skilling and development; helping people to take their careers and businesses forward.

We offer free events for networking, training, upskilling and development as well as a being an accessible platform for local people and businesses. We really believe in Brighton - and it’s potential.

Through Silicon Brighton, thought leaders and experts share knowledge with our community. Our [meetups](https://hub.siliconbrighton.com/topics) are driven by those who play an active part. Our Silicon Brighton community set the agenda, and together we upskill and grow.

We’re able to do what we do as we’re driven forward by an organisation with the contacts in place to ensure sessions are well attended and relevant. Our meetups make sure everyone leaves with both a number of learning experiences and new contacts who are keen to collaborate.
