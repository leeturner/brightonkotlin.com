      <description>Even though it is short notice, we thought what better way to finish the year than gathering in a pub and having a few drinks to celebrate a great end to the year.
It would be great to see at the Hope and Ruin on the 16th December from 6:30pm on-wards
We already have some great speakers lined up for the beginning of 2020 and we will be publishing those events very soon but for now, join us to toast the end of the year in Brighton Kotlin style.</description>

      <description>We are extremely lucky to have a talk this month by George Herbert from Capgemini where he will discuss how Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) was implemented at HMRC.
During this talk, he will talk about the reasons behind the use of KMP and how he made it work with iOS, Android and Web. Come along to find out whether KMP could be used in your projects or maybe just to pique your interest into the world of KMP!</description>

      <description>It was great to see so many people come along to the first ever Brighton Kotlin meetup. It really showed that there is an active Kotlin community in Brighton with people working on projects using a range of technologies from the Kotlin ecosystem. You can see the photos of the event at our meetup page - https://www.meetup.com/Brighton-Kotlin/photos/30344969/
At this meetup Lee Turner talked about how Crunch have been introducing Kotlin into their backend microservice architecture over the past year, the results and challenges they have seen during that time and where they plan to take it next.</description>
