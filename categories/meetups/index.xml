Compelling aspects of the Micronaut framework include:
Develop applications with Java, Kotlin, or Apache Groovy Sub-second startup time Small processes that can run in as little as 10 MB of JVM heap No runtime reflection Dependency injection and AOP Reflection-free serialization A database access toolkit that uses ahead-of-time (AoT) compilation to pre-compute queries for repository interfaces.</description>

      <description>Spring Boot, the convention-over-configuration centric framework from the Spring team at Pivotal, marries Spring&amp;rsquo;s flexibility with conventional, common sense defaults to make application development on the JVM not just fly, but pleasant! Spring Boot aims to make address the common functional and non-functional requirements that gate quickly moving to production. The framework is as clean as it gets, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice if the language matched its elegance?
Kotlin, the productivity-focused language from our friends at JetBrains, takes up the slack to make the experience leaner, cleaner and even more pleasant!</description>

      <description>Functional Programming is an excellent way to simplify your code and reduce bugs, and to make things even better, Kotlin provides a natural transition to using Functional Programming paradigms. But before that, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about what Functional Programming even is. In this talk, we&amp;rsquo;ll break down the key aspects of what defines Functional Programming and the key benefits of using Functional Programming paradigms. Then we&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through how to use Functional Programming more in your Kotlin code to really have the best of both worlds.</description>

      <description>Http4k is a lightweight HTTP library written in Kotlin that enables serving and consuming of HTTP services in a functional and testable way. Unlike many other libraries and frameworks which have complicated abstractions and workflows, http4k captures the essence of communication over HTTP with a few simple concepts. In this session I will explain and demo the core concepts in http4k by live coding from scratch an HTTP server which will simulate the board from the noughts and crosses game.</description>

      <description>Mobile, Web, Desktop&amp;hellip; when working with multiple platforms for your product, you might start to feel like there is a lot for your team to maintain. If we update the design for a feature or want to test a new layout, we often need to make that change in multiple clients. This results in more time spent on the same task in multiple places, with less time being able to focus on delivering even more value to your users.</description>

We already have some great speakers lined up for the beginning of 2020 and we will be publishing those events very soon but for now, join us to toast the end of the year in Brighton Kotlin style.</description>
